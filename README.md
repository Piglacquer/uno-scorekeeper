# uno-scorekeeper

> ITS TIME FOR SOME UNOOOOOO

I know chu wanna play some uno. Here's the deal with this app:

* It's a collaboration between Taylor Roberts and me.
* It's in its beginning stages.
* The goal is to have a vue frontend and a backend of some sort that will aid you in keeping score when playing yo sickass uno games.
* The frontend will take some user input and modify it.
* All scores will be stored in the database when the game ends, and will be accessible from the landing page so you can rub your friend's face in their last loss.
* Player names will be limited to 7 characters for layout reasons.
* A maximum of 8 players will be able to be added for space-around-the-table reasons.
* Taylor is working on the backend/css and I'm working on learning what the hell is going on.
